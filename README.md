# Symbol

I write a lot of emails at work. My work laptop is a wonderful Dell Precision. I love it, except that when I'm not plugged into a full keyboard it doesn't have a number pad. Which means normal alt codes don't work. This aims to be a repository for all of symbols I use frequently to copy and paste them.
